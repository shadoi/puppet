puppet (0.23.2-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Handling of the rundir setting has been changed; we now store PID files
    in /var/run/puppet, and the initscripts have been modified to ensure
    that this directory exists on startup.  It is no longer necessary to set
    rundir explicitly in /etc/puppet/puppet.conf, and you should ensure that
    you have no explicit rundir setting in your puppet.conf unless you want
    to use a custom rundir setting for your own local purposes.

puppet (0.23.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * This version of Puppet makes a fairly major change to the location of
    the CA and certificates, from /etc/puppet/ssl to the more FHS-compliant
    location /var/lib/puppet/ssl.  This is to be both policy-compliant and
    to match the location of the ssldir in other distributions.

    If you have transitioned to using the consolidated puppet.conf config
    file, there should be no problems.  If you are using a stock
    puppet.conf, the change should be made for you automatically, while if
    you've customised puppet.conf the ssldir will be left where it is and
    you should transition to the new location manually.

    The only source of problems is if you're still using per-program config
    files (puppetd.conf, puppetmasterd.conf, etc).  I haven't been able to
    work out a damage-free way of transitioning to the new location, so
    things will likely break for you -- ssldir will have been moved to
    /var/lib/puppet/ssl, but your puppet programs will use the
    old config file (with the default ssldir of /etc/puppet/ssl.  In this
    case, you'll likely get all sorts of certificate-related problems.

    The solution is to either switch to using puppet.conf (which is
    necessary anyway because support for the deprecated per-program config
    files will be going away sometime) with the new ssldir setting, or add
    the ssldir setting to all your per-program config files (this includes
    creating them for programs that don't already have a config file, like
    puppetca.conf).  Then delete /etc/puppet/ssl (since it's not needed) and
    use the existing SSL data that was moved to /var/lib/puppet/ssl.

puppet (0.23.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * As of upstream 0.23.0, the configuration file layout has been largely
    revamped.  Now, instead of having one file per program, there is now
    a single file, /etc/puppet/puppet.conf, which contains sections for
    each program, as well as a "main" section that sets global config
    options relevant for all programs.

    See http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/ConfigurationReference for
    more info.

    For backwards compatibility, all programs still read the per-program
    configuration files, and will ignore the generic puppet.conf file if the
    per-program file still exists.  To prevent accidents, you will need to
    do the configuration change manually, by rewriting puppet.conf to match
    your local configuration parameters and then deleting the old files.  If
    you haven't changed any config parameters, then it should be as simple
    as deleting puppetd.conf and puppetmasterd.conf and restarting the
    daemons, as the configuration itself hasn't changed between versions.
