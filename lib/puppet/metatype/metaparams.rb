            When you use this feature, the parser sets ``sshdconfig`` as the name,
            and the library sets that as an alias for the file so the dependency
            lookup for ``sshd`` works.  You can use this parameter yourself,
            but note that only the library can use these aliases; for instance,
            the following code will not work::

                file { \"/etc/ssh/sshd_config\":
                    owner => root,
                    group => root,
                    alias => sshdconfig
                }

                    mode => 644
                }

            There's no way here for the Puppet parser to know that these two stanzas
            should be affecting the same file.

            ways to autorequire objects, so if you think Puppet could be
            smarter here, let us know.

            In fact, the above code was redundant -- Puppet will autorequire
            any parent directories that are being managed; it will
            automatically realize that the parent directory should be created
            before the script is pulled down.

            Currently, exec resources will autorequire their CWD (if it is
            specified) plus any fully qualified paths that appear in the
            command.   For instance, if you had an ``exec`` command that ran
            the ``myscript`` mentioned above, the above code that pulls the
            file down would be automatically listed as a requirement to the
            ``exec`` code, so that you would always be running againts the
            most recent version.
