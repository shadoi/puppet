        for ``ldapuser`` and ``ldappassword``, so that your clients can write
        to ldap.

        Note that this provider will automatically generate a GID for you if
        you do not specify one, but it is a potentially expensive operation,
        as it iterates across all existing groups to pick the appropriate next
        one."
