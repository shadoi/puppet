    desc "Graph all available data about hosts using the RRD library.  You
        must have the Ruby RRDtool library installed to use this report, which
        you can get from `the RubyRRDTool RubyForge page`_.  This package may also
        be available as ``ruby-rrd`` or ``rrdtool-ruby`` in your distribution's package
        management system.  The library and/or package will both require the binary
        ``rrdtool`` package from your distribution to be installed.

        .. _the RubyRRDTool RubyForge page: http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyrrdtool/

        This report will create, manage, and graph RRD database files for each
        of the metrics generated during transactions, and it will create a
        few simple html files to display the reporting host's graphs.  At this
        point, it will not create a common index file to display links to
        all hosts.

        All RRD files and graphs get created in the ``rrddir`` directory.  If
        you want to serve these publicly, you should be able to just alias that
        directory in a web server.

        If you really know what you're doing, you can tune the ``rrdinterval``,
        which defaults to the ``runinterval``."
