Puppet::Type.newtype(:cron) do
    @doc = "Installs and manages cron jobs.  All fields except the command
        and the user are optional, although specifying no periodic
        fields would result in the command being executed every
        minute.  While the name of the cron job is not part of the actual
        job, it is used by Puppet to store and retrieve it.

        If you specify a cron job that matches an existing job in every way
        except name, then the jobs will be considered equivalent and the
        new name will be permanently associated with that job.  Once this
        association is made and synced to disk, you can then manage the job
        normally (e.g., change the schedule of the job).

        Example::

            cron { logrotate:
                command => \"/usr/sbin/logrotate\",
                user => root,
                hour => 2,
                minute => 0
            }

        Note that all cron values can be specified as an array of values::

            cron { logrotate:
                command => \"/usr/sbin/logrotate\",
                user => root,
                hour => [2, 4]
            }

        Or using ranges, or the step syntax ``*/2`` (although there's no guarantee that
        your ``cron`` daemon supports it)::

            cron { logrotate:
                command => \"/usr/sbin/logrotate\",
                user => root,
                hour => ['2-4'],
                minute => '*/10'
            }
