        @doc = "Executes external commands.  It is critical that all commands
            executed using this mechanism can be run multiple times without
            harm, i.e., they are *idempotent*.  One useful way to create idempotent
            commands is to use the checks like ``creates`` to avoid running the
            command unless some condition is met.

            Note also that you can restrict an ``exec`` to only run when it receives
            events by using the ``refreshonly`` parameter; this is a useful way to
            have your configuration respond to events with arbitrary commands.

            It is worth noting that ``exec`` is special, in that it is not
            currently considered an error to have multiple ``exec`` instances
            with the same name.  This was done purely because it had to be this
            way in order to get certain functionality, but it complicates things.
            In particular, you will not be able to use ``exec`` instances that
            share their commands with other instances as a dependency, since
            Puppet has no way of knowing which instance you mean.

            For example::

                # defined in the production class
                exec { \"make\":
                    cwd => \"/prod/build/dir\",
                    path => \"/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin\"
                }

                . etc. .

                # defined in the test class
                exec { \"make\":
                    cwd => \"/test/build/dir\",
                    path => \"/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin\"
                }

            Any other type would throw an error, complaining that you had
            the same instance being managed in multiple places, but these are
            obviously different images, so ``exec`` had to be treated specially.

            It is recommended to avoid duplicate names whenever possible.

            Note that if an ``exec`` receives an event from another resource,
            it will get executed again (or execute the command specified in
            ``refresh``, if there is one).

            There is a strong tendency to use ``exec`` to do whatever work Puppet
            can't already do; while this is obviously acceptable (and unavoidable)
            in the short term, it is highly recommended to migrate work from ``exec``
            to native Puppet types as quickly as possible.  If you find that
            you are doing a lot of work with ``exec``, please at least notify
            us at Reductive Labs what you are doing, and hopefully we can work with
            you to get a native resource type for the work you are doing."
