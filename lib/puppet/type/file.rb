        newparam(:backup) do
            desc "Whether files should be backed up before
                being replaced.  The preferred method of backing files up is via
                a ``filebucket``, which stores files by their MD5 sums and allows
                easy retrieval without littering directories with backups.  You
                can specify a local filebucket or a network-accessible
                server-based filebucket by setting ``backup => bucket-name``.
                Alternatively, if you specify any value that begins with a ``.``
                (e.g., ``.puppet-bak``), then Puppet will use copy the file in
                the same directory with that value as the extension of the
                backup. Setting ``backup => false`` disables all backups of the
                file in question.

                Puppet automatically creates a local filebucket named ``puppet`` and
                defaults to backing up there.  To use a server-based filebucket,
                you must specify one in your configuration::

                    filebucket { main:
                        server => puppet
                    }

                The ``puppetmasterd`` daemon creates a filebucket by default,
                so you can usually back up to your main server with this
                configuration.  Once you've described the bucket in your
                configuration, you can use it in any file::

                    file { \"/my/file\":
                        source => \"/path/in/nfs/or/something\",
                        backup => main
                    }

                This will back the file up to the central server.

                At this point, the benefits of using a filebucket are that you do not
                have backup files lying around on each of your machines, a given
                version of a file is only backed up once, and you can restore
                any given file manually, no matter how old.  Eventually,
                transactional support will be able to automatically restore
                filebucketed files.
