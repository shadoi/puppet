module Puppet
    # Copy files from a local or remote source.  This state *only* does any work
    # when the remote file is an actual file; in that case, this state copies
    # the file down.  If the remote file is a dir or a link or whatever, then
    # this state, during retrieval, modifies the appropriate other states
    # so that things get taken care of appropriately.
    Puppet.type(:file).newproperty(:source) do
        include Puppet::Util::Diff

        attr_accessor :source, :local
        desc "Copy a file over the current file.  Uses ``checksum`` to
            determine when a file should be copied.  Valid values are either
            fully qualified paths to files, or URIs.  Currently supported URI
            types are *puppet* and *file*.

            This is one of the primary mechanisms for getting content into
            applications that Puppet does not directly support and is very
            useful for those configuration files that don't change much across
            sytems.  For instance::

                class sendmail {
                    file { \"/etc/mail/sendmail.cf\":
                        source => \"puppet://server/module/sendmail.cf\"
                    }
                }

            You can also leave out the server name, in which case ``puppetd``
            will fill in the name of its configuration server and ``puppet``
            will use the local filesystem.  This makes it easy to use the same
            configuration in both local and centralized forms.

            Currently, only the ``puppet`` scheme is supported for source
            URL's. Puppet will connect to the file server running on
            ``server`` to retrieve the contents of the file. If the
            ``server`` part is empty, the behavior of the command-line
            interpreter (``puppet``) and the client demon (``puppetd``) differs
            slightly: ``puppet`` will look such a file up on the module path
            on the local host, whereas ``puppetd`` will connect to the
            puppet server that it received the manifest from.

            See the `FileServingConfiguration fileserver configuration documentation`:trac: for information on how to configure
            and use file services within Puppet.

            If you specify multiple file sources for a file, then the first
            source that exists will be used.  This allows you to specify
            what amount to search paths for files::

                file { \"/path/to/my/file\":
                    source => [
                        \"/nfs/files/file.$host\",
                        \"/nfs/files/file.$operatingsystem\",
                        \"/nfs/files/file\"
                    ]
                }

            This will use the first found file as the source.

            You cannot currently copy links using this mechanism; set ``links``
            to ``follow`` if any remote sources are links.
