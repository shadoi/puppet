# Manage Unix groups.  This class is annoyingly complicated; There
# is some variety in whether systems use 'groupadd' or 'addgroup', but OS X
# significantly complicates the picture by using NetInfo.  Eventually we
# will also need to deal with systems that have their groups hosted elsewhere
# (e.g., in LDAP).  That will likely only be a problem for OS X, since it
# currently does not use the POSIX interfaces, since lookupd's cache screws
# things up.
