            sun) cannot.  For those package formats that cannot retrieve
            their own files, you can use the ``source`` parameter to point to
            the correct file.

            Puppet will automatically guess the packaging format that you are
            using based on the platform you are on, but you can override it
            using the ``provider`` parameter; each provider defines what it
            requires in order to function, and you must meet those requirements
            to use a given provider."
