            concept of a running service, and some have a very codified and
            powerful concept.  Puppet's service support will generally be able
            to make up for any inherent shortcomings (e.g., if there is no
            'status' command, then Puppet will look in the process table for a
            command matching the service name), but the more information you
            can provide the better behaviour you will get.  Or, you can just
            use a platform that has very good service support.

            Note that if a ``service`` receives an event from another resource,
            the service will get restarted. The actual command to restart the
