.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a stand\-alone filebucket client for sending files to a local or
central filebucket.


.SH USAGE
This client can operate in three modes, with only one mode per call:


.TP
.B backup:  Send one or more files to the specified file bucket. Each sent
file is printed with its resulting md5 sum.


.TP
.B get:     Return the text associated with an md5 sum. The text is printed
to stdout, and only one file can be retrieved at a time.


.TP
.B restore: Given a file path and an md5 sum, store the content associated
with the sum into the specified file path. You can specify an
entirely new path to this argument; you are not restricted to
restoring the content to its original location.

Note that +filebucket+ defaults to using a network\-based filebucket
available on the server named +puppet+. To use this, you\'ll have to be
running as a user with valid Puppet certificates. Alternatively, you can
use your local file bucket by specifying +\-\-local+.


.SH EXAMPLE

.\" visit_block_quote
$ filebucket backup /etc/passwd
/etc/passwd: 429b225650b912a2ee067b0a4cf1e949
$ filebucket restore /tmp/passwd 429b225650b912a2ee067b0a4cf1e949
$


.\" depart_block_quote

.SH OPTIONS
Note that any configuration parameter that\'s valid in the configuration
file is also a valid long argument. For example, \'ssldir\' is a valid
configuration parameter, so you can specify \'\-\-ssldir <directory>\' as an
argument.

See the configuration file documentation at
http://reductivelabs.com/projects/puppet/reference/configref.html for
the full list of acceptable parameters. A commented list of all
configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with
\'\-\-genconfig\'.

debug:   Enable full debugging.

help:    Print this help message


.TP
.B local:   Use the local filebucket. This will use the default
configuration information.


.TP
.B remote:  Use a remote filebucket. This will use the default
configuration information.

server:  The server to send the file to, instead of locally.

verbose: Print extra information.

version: Print version information.
