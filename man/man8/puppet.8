.SH DESCRIPTION
This is the standalone puppet execution script; use it to execute
individual scripts that you write. If you need to execute site\-wide
scripts, use +puppetd+ and +puppetmasterd+.


.SH OPTIONS
Note that any configuration parameter that\'s valid in the configuration
file is also a valid long argument. For example, \'ssldir\' is a valid
configuration parameter, so you can specify \'\-\-ssldir <directory>\' as an
argument.

See the configuration file documentation at
http://reductivelabs.com/projects/puppet/reference/configref.html for
the full list of acceptable parameters. A commented list of all
configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with
\'\-\-genconfig\'.

debug:       Enable full debugging.

help:        Print this help message


.TP
.B loadclasses: Load any stored classes. +puppetd+ caches configured
classes (usually at /etc/puppet/classes.txt), and setting
this option causes all of those classes to be set in your
+puppet+ manifest.


.TP
.B logdest:     Where to send messages. Choose between syslog, the console,
and a log file. Defaults to sending messages to the
console.

verbose:     Print extra information.
